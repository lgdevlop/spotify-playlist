# 🔴 SEC-001: Client Secret Exposure in Plain Text

## 📋 Basic Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Vulnerability ID** | SEC-001 |
| **Severity** | Critical |
| **CVSS Score** | 9.8 |
| **Component** | API Config |
| **Location** | `app/api/config/route.ts:73` |
| **Discovery Date** | 10/04/2025 |
| **Status** | Open |

## 🎯 Description

The GET `/api/config` endpoint returns Spotify credentials (clientId and clientSecret) directly to the client, including the decrypted clientSecret. This vulnerability allows any user with access to the application to obtain the complete Spotify credentials.

### Potential Impact

- Complete compromise of developer's Spotify account
- Unauthorized access to user data
- Possibility of malicious actions on behalf of the application
- Credential theft and abuse

### Exploitation Examples

```javascript
// Simple request exposes credentials
fetch('/api/config')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data.clientSecret)); // Credential exposed
```

### Evidence Found

```typescript
const response = NextResponse.json(config || { clientId: "", clientSecret: "", redirectUri: "" });
```

## 🔧 Remediation Plan

### Specific Actions Required

1. Completely remove clientSecret from GET `/api/config` endpoint response
2. Implement server-side only credentials flow
3. Modify client to not depend on clientSecret
4. Implement enhanced session validation

### Detailed Remediation Steps

#### Step 1: Remove Client Secret Exposure

Remove clientSecret from the API response and implement server-side credential management.

```typescript
// Remove clientSecret from response
const response = NextResponse.json({
  clientId: config?.clientId || "",
  redirectUri: config?.redirectUri || "",
  hasCredentials: !!config
});
```

#### Step 2: Implement Server-Side Flow

Move Spotify authentication logic to server-side and implement a proxy for Spotify API calls.

```typescript
// Implement server-side OAuth flow
export async function exchangeCodeForTokens(code: string) {
  const credentials = await getCredentialsFromSession();
  const response = await fetch("https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      "Authorization": `Basic ${Buffer.from(`${credentials.clientId}:${credentials.clientSecret}`).toString('base64')}`
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      grant_type: "authorization_code",
      code,
      redirect_uri: credentials.redirectUri
    })
  });
  
  return response.json();
}
```

### Dependencies Between Fixes

- **Depends on:** SEC-003 (secure credential storage)
- **Unblocks:** SEC-002 (secure token management)

### Implementation Risks

- **High:** Breaking existing functionality
- **Medium:** Significant client refactoring required
- **Low:** Additional complexity in session management

### ✍️ What was done

This PR implements the security fix for vulnerability SEC-001 (critical severity) in the API Config component.

* Removed exposure of clientSecret from GET /api/config endpoint
* Added proper input validation for Spotify credential parameters
* Implemented secure logging practices to prevent credential leakage
* Added security headers to prevent unauthorized access
* Updated session management to use per-session credential storage

### 📌 Why it matters

Without this change, the application is vulnerable to credential theft which could lead to complete compromise of the Spotify developer account. Attackers could obtain the client secret and make unauthorized API calls, compromising user data and application integrity.

This fix ensures that sensitive credentials are never exposed to the client and helps prevent credential theft by implementing server-side only credential management.

### 🧪 How to test

1. Start the application and navigate to the configuration component
2. Attempt to access GET /api/config endpoint
3. Verify that the response no longer contains clientSecret
4. Check that logs no longer contain sensitive information
5. Validate that normal functionality remains intact
6. Run security tests: `bun run test:security`
