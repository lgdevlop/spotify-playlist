# Project Scope and Objectives

## Project Overview

This project is a web application built with Next.js that generates personalized Spotify playlists based on the user's musical taste. The app leverages Spotify's API to access the user's playlists and listening data, and uses AI powered by OpenAI GPT or similar large language models to analyze and identify the user's music preferences. Based on this analysis, the app generates new playlists tailored to the user's unique taste.

## Scope

- Integration with Spotify API to fetch user playlists and listening data.
- Use of AI (OpenAI GPT or similar) to analyze musical taste from one or multiple playlists or the entire user library.
- Generation of new Spotify playlists based on AI analysis.
- Frontend built with Next.js and UI components potentially using shadcn UI library.
- User authentication via Spotify OAuth.
- Responsive web design for desktop and mobile devices.

## Objectives

- Provide users with a seamless way to discover new music tailored to their taste.
- Utilize AI to enhance playlist generation beyond simple heuristics.
- Ensure secure and privacy-conscious handling of user data.
- Deliver a performant and user-friendly web application.
- Document the architecture, requirements, and setup for future development and maintenance.

## Out of Scope

- Direct music playback within the app.
- Offline playlist generation without Spotify API access.
- Support for other music streaming services beyond Spotify.
